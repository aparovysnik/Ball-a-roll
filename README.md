Ball-a-roll
===========

C++ 3D game engine built for ball-rolling adventures. The software uses BulletPhysics, FreeType and SDL Mixer libraries. It is currently targetted at OpenGL 4.x, but is known to work well on some older OpenGL versions.

Controls
===========
The UI is currently very basic. The main menu is controlled using left mouse button.

Gameplay controls:
W - roll forward
S - roll backward
A - turn leftward
D - turn rightward
LEFT ARROW - roll left
RIGHT ARROW - roll right
SPACE - jump
ESC - pause
R - restart

Gameplay
===========
There is little gameplay at the moment, but this will be expanded soon.

The main aim of the game is to get from the start of the track to its end without falling from the platforms. As simple as that! =)

Enjoy!
